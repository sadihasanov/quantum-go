Browser game for first Quantum Go

Quantum Go differs from regular Go in a way that each move requires you to put two stones at different locations.
Those stones are linked just like two particles are linked through quantum entanglement. 

Important and most fun part of it - whenever your opponent puts a stone next to yours, 1 of your stones will collapse. Probability of either of stones collapsing is equal.
Essentially, you have to take your strategical thinking to whole another level by planning different possibilities and scenarious. 
Quantum Computers have struggle with it but humans are more creative. So, let's see the outcome!
